    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Modern warfare requires close integration of military and intelligence forces. The Secretary of Defense possesses authorities under Title 10 and Title 50 and is best suited to lead US government operations against external unconventional and cyber threats.  Titles 10 and 50 create mutually supporting, not mutually exclusive, authorities. There are 58 chapters to Title 50 that give depth on policies and strategies. Operations conducted under military command and control pursuant to a Secretary of Defense-issued execute order are military operations and not intelligence activities. Attempts by congressional overseers to redefine military preparatory operations as intelligence activities are legally and historically unsupportable. Congress should revise its antiquated oversight structure to reflect our integrated and interconnected world.
